#Thermostat Requirements

- Thermostat starts at 20 degrees

- You can increase the temp with the up button

- You can decrease the temp with the down button

- The minimum temperature is 10 degrees

- If power saving mode is on, the maximum temperature is 25 degrees

- If power saving mode is off, the maximum temperature is 32 degrees

- Power saving mode is on by default

- You can reset the temperature to 20 by hitting the reset button

- thermostat should color the display based on energy usage - < 18 is green, < 25 is yellow, otherwise red


#Notes:
Worked on by Andy Newman (@andyg72) and Jacob Mitchinson (@jacobmitchinson) during week 5 at Makers Academy.
This was our first introduction to javascript, jQuery and with little experience of CSS.

Code is reasionably elegant with strong separation of methods.

Most issues came with the CSS as we tried to match a design created by the coach, which involved an SVG image that we didn't have, so we compromised and used text instead.

What we would do to improve it;
  - work on a slightly neater way of applying CSS colour styling that is based on temperature and power saving mode status.
